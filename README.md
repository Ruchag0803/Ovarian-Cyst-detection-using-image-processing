# Project: Ovarian Cyst Detection

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a system for identifying and classifying ovarian cysts present in medical images. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the ovaries, and they can vary in size and complexity. This project aims to provide a tool that assists medical professionals in accurately detecting and categorizing these cysts.

### Project Description:
The project involves the development of an image processing and machine learning system to analyze medical images of the ovaries. The process includes several steps:

1. Image Preprocessing: The input images are preprocessed to enhance contrast and remove noise using techniques such as histogram equalization and morphological operations.

2. Segmentation: The preprocessed images are segmented to isolate regions of interest, such as cysts, using techniques like thresholding and morphological operations.

3. Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the segmented regions to characterize the detected cysts. These features may include size, shape, texture, and intensity.

4. Visualization and Evaluation: The project evaluates the system's performance using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to assess its effectiveness. This process guides further improvements and optimizations.

### Future Scope:
One potential future direction for this project is to enhance the classification model to differentiate between different types of ovarian cysts, including distinguishing between cancerous and non-cancerous cysts. This would involve collecting a larger dataset with labeled examples of different types of ovarian cysts and training more sophisticated machine learning models, such as deep learning neural networks. Additionally, integrating clinical data and patient information into the classification process could improve the accuracy and clinical relevance of the system.

### Conclusion:
The Ovarian Cyst Classification project aims to develop a computer-aided diagnostic system for detecting and classifying ovarian cysts in medical images. By leveraging image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system provides a valuable tool for medical professionals to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cysts. With further development and refinement, the system has the potential to improve patient outcomes and contribute to advancements in the field of medical imaging and diagnostics.
